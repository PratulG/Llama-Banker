# Llama-Banker
This application is designed to extract answers from financial statements provided in PDF format, sourced from a company's annual financial release. Users can pose questions like "What is the company's equity?" and the application will retrieve the relevant information. The underlying script is tailored for execution in a Google Colab environment with high RAM, leveraging a T4 GPU. For the extraction and response process, it utilizes the "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf" model hosted locally.
